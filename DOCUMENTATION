==== Architecture explanation ====
There are three main components: worker, version catalog and manager.

Worker knows about version of database scheme currently deployed, knows
how to change this version, knows how to perform updates, downgrades, and
uninstalls.

Version catalog knows about patches - where they are, how to load them, etc.

Manager operates with these both components, allowing you to perform
updates and downgrades, and also uninstalls. It asks catalog about all
available versions, asks worker about current version, sorts things out
and lets worker perform required operations.

==== Why it is like that ====

You only need to adapt worker and catalog to your needs.
Worker needs to know only database-specific stuff, while catalog needs to know
how to retrieve and provide patches.

API is pretty simple for both of them.

Worker is required to implement such functions as get_current_version, set_current_version,
upgrade, downgrade and uninstall.
Catalog is required to implement only one function - get_available_versions.
